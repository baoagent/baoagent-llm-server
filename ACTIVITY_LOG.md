# Activity Log - Twilio Voice Server Implementation

This log outlines the steps to implement the Twilio Voice Server for the moving company MVP, as detailed in the `README.md`.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Dependencies

-   [x] Initialize Project Structure as per `README.md`.
-   [x] Create `package.json` with required dependencies.
-   [x] Install dependencies using `npm install`.
-   [x] Create and configure `.env` file from `.env.example` (if it exists) or from scratch.

## Phase 2: Twilio Voice Integration

-   [x] Implement webhook handler for incoming calls (`/voice/incoming`).
-   [x] Generate TwiML response to establish Media Stream.
-   [x] Implement Media Stream WebSocket handler.
-   [x] Handle different message types from Twilio (`connected`, `start`, `media`, `stop`).
-   [x] Ensure correct audio format handling (G.711 Î¼-law).

## Phase 3: OpenAI Realtime API Integration

-   [x] Implement WebSocket connection management for OpenAI Realtime API.
-   [x] Implement session configuration with system instructions and voice settings.
-   [x] Implement function calling integration for MCP tools.
-   [x] Implement bidirectional audio streaming between Twilio and OpenAI.

## Phase 4: MCP Server Integration

-   [ ] Set up the client for the MCP server.
-   [x] Implement the tool invocation handler to call MCP tools based on OpenAI function calls.
-   [x] Implement error handling for MCP server communication.
-   [ ] **Note:** The MCP server needs to be set up separately. The user mentioned `baoagent.com`. We need to clarify if we can host the MCP server there or if we need to set it up somewhere else.

## Phase 5: Advanced Features

-   [x] Implement call state management.
-   [x] Implement robust error recovery.
-   [x] Set up monitoring and logging.

## Deployment and Testing

-   [x] Set up local development environment with `ngrok`.
-   [x] Write unit and integration tests.
-   [ ] Choose a deployment platform (Railway, Render, Heroku, or Docker).
-   [ ] Deploy the application.
-   [ ] Configure Twilio webhook to point to the deployed application.
